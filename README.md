# GoThrough

⭐ Star us on GitHub — it motivates us a lot!

GoThrough is an AI model, that reduces and directs traffic based on the amount of vehicles accumulated. It also alerts when an emergency vehicle arrives and also detects traffic rule violations.

## Why?
• It prioritizes emergency vehicles when detected, instead of fighting its way through the traffic.

• Dynamically allocates time for each road based on the amount and type of vehicles accumulated.
